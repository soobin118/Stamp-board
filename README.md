# Stamp-board
*This project is implemented using OpenGL.*

You can seal using the stamps located top of the board.  
When you pushes right button of the mouse, it shows the menu including quit and clear functions.  
When you pushes middle button of the mouse, it shows the menu including color, size, fill functions.  
I implemented every stamps by defining the position of the vertices.
